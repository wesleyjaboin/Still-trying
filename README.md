I want to do a carrer change, which is the reason I am doing this progam, hoping to have a more fruitful career and having the opportunity to spend time with my family.



# For fun #

still working on it


In my spare time I love to workout and help others reach and fufilll their fitness journey. I do a little bit of CrossFit, bodybuilding, due to lack of time latey i haven't been playing much sport, but ultimately I love basketball and football, pretty much anything that will be considered competetive. 

I also love learning about other people and culture. through food, dance, music, history, etc. pretty much anything that is new and foreign to me. I speak three languages: 

* English 
* Creole

* French
* Sapnish ( a little )
